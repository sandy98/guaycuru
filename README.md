# Guaycuru Web Server
# Static Web Server built on top of Node Simple Router

## Install

From Node Package Manager:

<pre>
  npm install guaycuru
</pre>

or from source:

<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/sandy98/guaycuru.git
</pre>

## Purpose
Serves static content with root at the directory it is run from.

## Dependencies
Node Simple Router

## Basic Usage
```bash
cd mywebdir
guaycuru
```
## That's it
Well, almost. 
As of current version (0.0.2) Guaycuru is able (and will attempt to) run cgi programs located under its cgi directory,
which defaults to cgi-bin. This may be configured through the command line, along the lines of:
guaycuru [port] [cgi directory]
Port defaults to 8000 and cgi directory, as was previously mentioned, defaults to "cgi-bin" 


## Note

The name stands for an indian group that used to live in the sorroundings of my home town - no apaches or cherokees
around here... -
